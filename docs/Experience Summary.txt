Customer Domain	Sales Compensation and performance Management, Retails Appointment Scheduling.

•	The project SCA is to have a combination of application clubbed together to perform task independently. 
•	SC4LS application is used to calculate compensation benefits for call centre agent.
•	SRS application is response to the Personal Accountability Reporting initiative, and is intended to provide individual customer service agent’s daily feedback on their performance meeting standard call centre metrics.
•	PDTS application capture daily Human Resource and Legal discussion and discipline performance data via electronic storage instead of paper based files.
•	Q-RAS application is used to create online appointment to ATT retails stores for ATT Customer.

Copy?
A reference copy, as the name implies, creates a copy of a reference variable pointing to an object.

An object copy creates a copy of the object itself.

hashCode() method is used to get the hash Code of an object. hashCode() method of object class returns the memory reference of object in integer form. In HashMap, hashCode() is used to calculate the bucket and therefore calculate the index.

equals method is used to check that 2 objects are equal or not. HashMap uses equals() to compare the key whether the are equal or not.

A bucket is one element of HashMap array. It is used to store nodes. Two or more nodes can have the same bucket. In that case link list structure is used to connect the nodes. A single bucket can have more than one nodes, it depends on hashCode() method. The better your hashCode() method is, the better your buckets will be utilized.

Index Calculation in Hashmap:
Hash code of key may be large to create an array => may cause outOfMemoryException. Hence, we generate index to minimize the size of array. 
index = hashCode(key) & (n-1); where n is number of buckets or the size of array. 16 is the default size.

Multiple languages support functional programming like java, javascript, scala etc. 

It implies that the local scope of a variable can't be changed. Related to Anonymous class method implementation in java.

Anonymous class (inner class)-> a class that doesn't carry a name in it. Always map to a reference of an interface or abstract class. Provides support for functional programming.

Lambda's => functional programming with ease. Lambda's => Expressiveness. Since Java 1.8.

Target Typing => Passing Lambda syntax as a param to a method
